# QlikView Components

A library for common QlikView Scripting tasks

## Mission
Qlikview Components (Qvc) is a library of script subroutines and functions. The mission of Qlikview Components is:

>Implement scripting best practices encapsulated by a simple and stable API.
>Improve the speed and quality of script development.
>Create common ground between script developers.
>QVC aims to serve the needs of the "big middle" of script tasks. Not the simple tasks, not the very complex tasks, but the garden variety common needs found in many scripts.

## Getting Started
To get started using Qvc, download the latest distribution file from the [Releases](https://github.com/RobWunderlich/Qlikview-Components/releases) section. 
Unzip the distribution and copy the Qvc_Runtime folder to the same place as your QlikView document. Add          ```$(Include=.\qvc_runtime\qvc.qvs); ``` 
at the top of the QlikView load script, or create a new tab called Includes and put the include script in there.
